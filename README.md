# learning-time
#Hello Professor, my name is Mark and I am putting some information about myself in order to follow the instructions given on the guide you shared in the assignment.
#I live in California, I have the goal of graduating with my CIS degree and hopping into the workforce as soon as possible.  
#As the guide says, I'm using hashtags (#) in order to ensure my messages are not rated as lines of code, so hopefully everything should be fine.  
UPDATE, after review, it appears I do not need to worry about the hash symbol.
